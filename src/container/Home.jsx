              I love all art. My eyes and thoughts depict everything as art.
              Whatever was built, drawn, crafted, or constructed is considered
              art to me.
              <br />
              <br />
              My name is Jordan Canty and I am a Graphic Designer/Photographer.
              I was born and raised in Queens, New York and I am 28 years old.
              If you ask any of my friends about me they would most likely tell
              you I am creative. I really like to think outside of the box when
              it comes to designs. How else are you supposed to create/build
              something from the ground up if you are thinking like everyone
              else?
              <br />
              <br />I am highly skilled with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop
              and Adobe Indesign. If I am not doing anything with digital art
              then I am most likely either drawing something new or taking
              pictures of unique things. â€‹
              <br />
              <br />I have had the great fortune of working on some truly
              inspiring projects while networking with many influential and
              creative individuals along the way. I believe in the power of
              working together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of
              its parts. For more information about my career experience, past
              projects, and current Graphic Design Portfolio, get in touch
              today.
